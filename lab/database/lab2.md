# Lab 2: Data binding

In this exercise you will:

- Learn that the basic principle of data binding is this: you tell a control where to find your data and how you want it displayed, and the control handles the rest of the details.
- ASP.NET data binding works in one direction only. Information moves from a data object into a control. Then the data objects are thrown away, and the page is sent to the client. If the user modifies the data in a data-bound control, your program can update the corresponding record in the database, but nothing happens automatically.
- Learn about many of the most powerful databinding controls, such as the GridView and DetailsView, which give you unprecedented control over the presentation of your data, allowing you to format it, change its layout, embed it in other ASP.NET controls, and so on.
